# **Integrating Anthropic's Model Context Protocol with GitHub Copilot in VS Code**

The landscape of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, with large language models (LLMs) increasingly capable of augmenting various aspects of software development. A significant advancement in this domain is the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic. This open standard serves as a universal interface, streamlining the way LLMs interact with external tools, databases, and APIs, much like a USB-C port standardizes device connectivity. Initially developed to enhance Claude's capabilities, MCP was open-sourced in early 2024, aiming to foster industry-wide adoption and promote modularity, interoperability, and developer productivity in AI applications. By enabling language models to dynamically invoke APIs, interact with databases, and avoid hardcoded logic, MCP is fundamentally reshaping how AI models integrate with the real world, moving from isolated systems to flexible, tool-aware agents.1 This report details the process of integrating MCP with GitHub Copilot within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment, leveraging the provided research material to offer a comprehensive guide.

## **Prerequisites**

Before embarking on the integration process, several prerequisites must be met. Firstly, it is essential to have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed. Regular updates ensure access to the newest features and improvements, including those related to GitHub Copilot and MCP integration.6 Secondly, a GitHub account is required to utilize GitHub Copilot.6 Furthermore, having either Python or Node.js installed on your system is necessary as MCP servers are frequently built using these languages.6 Finally, access to GitHub Copilot is a fundamental requirement. Users can explore the free tier with limited functionality or opt for a paid subscription for unlimited access.6

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**

Preparing the development environment is the crucial first step in integrating MCP with GitHub Copilot. To ensure a smooth experience, updating Visual Studio Code to the latest version is paramount. VS Code typically supports automatic updates, prompting users to install new releases as they become available. Users can also manually check for updates by navigating to "Help" \> "Check for Updates" on Linux and Windows, or "Code" \> "Check for Updates" on macOS.10  
Next, logging into your GitHub account within VS Code is necessary to enable GitHub Copilot functionality. This can be done through the Accounts menu in the Activity Bar on the left side of the VS Code window. Clicking on the Accounts menu will present options to sign in with your GitHub credentials.17 Alternatively, the Command Palette (accessible via Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) can be used to search for "GitHub Copilot: Sign in".18 Following the prompts will guide you through the authentication process in a browser window, where you'll authorize Visual Studio Code to access your GitHub account.16  
Ensuring that Python or Node.js is installed is the next key step. For Python, Anthropic recommends version 3.10 or higher for optimal compatibility with the MCP Python SDK.26 Users can verify their Python installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running python \--version or python3 \--version. If Python is not installed or the version is outdated, it can be downloaded from the official Python website. Similarly, for Node.js, version 18 or later is recommended.29 The Node.js installation can be checked by running node \--version in the terminal. Node.js can be downloaded and installed from the official Node.js website. The Node Package Manager (npm), which usually comes bundled with Node.js, might also be required for installing some MCP tools.30  
Finally, the necessary MCP tools need to be installed. The original query mentioned a specific webpage for this purpose. However, based on the research material, the primary source for MCP servers and tools is the official Model Context Protocol GitHub organization, particularly the "servers" repository.6 This repository hosts a collection of reference implementations for MCP servers, showcasing the protocol's versatility. Installation methods can vary depending on the specific server and its implementation language (Python or Node.js). For Python-based servers, tools like pip or uv can be used to install packages from PyPI.25 For Node.js-based servers, npm or npx are the common tools for installation.29 The documentation within the "servers" repository or the individual server's documentation will provide specific installation instructions.

## **Step 2: Configuring MCP in VS Code**

With the environment set up, the next step involves configuring MCP within Visual Studio Code. MCP servers can be configured either for a specific workspace or globally for your personal VS Code instance.6 Configuring for a specific workspace involves creating a .vscode/mcp.json file in the root of your repository. This makes the MCP server configuration accessible to anyone who opens the project in VS Code. For personal, global configuration, the settings are added to the settings.json file within VS Code. It's generally recommended to choose only one location per server to avoid potential conflicts.6  
The configuration itself is a JSON file that specifies the details of the MCP servers you wish to use. A common structure involves an "inputs" section to define any necessary configuration values and a "servers" section to list the MCP servers. Each server entry typically includes a "command" to execute and an array of "args" (arguments) to pass to the command.6 For example, to configure the "fetch" MCP server, which provides web content fetching capabilities, the following configuration can be added to the .vscode/mcp.json file:

JSON

{  
  "inputs":,  
  "servers": {  
    "fetch": {  
      "command": "uvx",  
      "args": \["mcp-server-fetch"\]  
    }  
  }  
}

In this example, the "inputs" section defines a simple string input, and the "servers" section defines the "fetch" server with the command "uvx" and the argument "mcp-server-fetch".6 After saving the .vscode/mcp.json file, a "Start" button will appear at the top of the list of servers in the file. Clicking this button will start the configured MCP servers, which will then be available for use within GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode.6 To access the list of available MCP servers and their tools, open Copilot Chat by clicking the icon in the VS Code title bar, select "Agent" mode, and then click the tools icon in the top left corner of the chat box.6

## **Step 3: Writing and Testing MCP Code**

While the primary focus is on using pre-built MCP servers, developers may also want to create their own custom servers to fulfill specific needs. Anthropic provides SDKs in various languages like Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, and C\# to facilitate the development of MCP servers and clients.28 Building an MCP server generally involves defining the resources, prompts, and tools that the server will expose using the chosen SDK.3 Resources are structured data that the server can provide to the LLM, prompts are pre-prepared instructions or templates, and tools are executable functions or actions that the LLM can invoke.3 The logic for these tools needs to be implemented to interact with external systems, databases, or APIs.3 Once developed, the server can be run locally for testing or deployed remotely for broader accessibility.38 The availability of SDKs in multiple languages significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers wanting to create custom MCP servers tailored to their specific needs, as it allows them to leverage their existing skills in languages like Python, TypeScript, Java, and C\# without needing to learn a new language specifically for MCP.  
Testing MCP integrations within VS Code is a crucial part of the development process. The MCP Inspector is a valuable visual testing tool that can be used to inspect and debug MCP servers.5 Additionally, GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode provides an interactive environment for testing the tools exposed by configured MCP servers.6 By engaging with Copilot Chat in Agent mode, developers can invoke the tools provided by their MCP servers and observe the responses. VS Code also allows viewing server logs, which can be invaluable for troubleshooting issues with server connectivity or tool execution.38 The "MCP: List Servers" command in the Command Palette offers a way to manage and view the output of configured servers.40 Furthermore, developers can even leverage Copilot's AI capabilities to generate tests for their MCP-related code, ensuring its reliability and correctness.45

## **Step 4: Advanced Features and Customization**

The integration of MCP with GitHub Copilot in VS Code unlocks several advanced features and customization possibilities. A key aspect is the utilization of Agent Mode in Copilot Chat with MCP tools. Agent Mode goes beyond simple question answering by intelligently leveraging the available MCP tools to fulfill complex user requests.8 When a user enters a prompt in Agent Mode, Copilot can analyze the request and, based on the configured MCP servers and their tools, determine the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome. This might involve invoking multiple tools, processing the results, and potentially asking the user for further input or confirmation.8  
Managing and selecting specific tools within Copilot Chat's Agent Mode is also straightforward. By clicking the "Tools" button in the Chat view, users can see a list of all available tools provided by the configured MCP servers.6 They can then toggle specific tools on or off as needed, effectively controlling which tools Copilot can utilize for a given task. It's also possible to directly reference a tool in the chat prompt by typing "\#" followed by the tool name.44  
When Copilot invokes an MCP tool in Agent Mode, it typically presents the user with a confirmation dialog before executing the tool. This allows users to review the tool's parameters and either confirm the execution or edit the parameters if necessary.6 This step is crucial for security, as MCP tools can potentially perform actions that modify files or interact with external systems. For frequently used tools, users can also set up automatic confirmation for the current session, workspace, or all future invocations.44  
As mentioned earlier, developing custom MCP servers allows for highly specialized functionalities tailored to specific workflows or integrations with internal systems.43 Furthermore, MCP servers are not limited to running locally; they can also be hosted remotely, expanding the possibilities for integration and allowing access to tools and data from anywhere with network connectivity.43  
It's important to note that MCP's utility extends beyond GitHub Copilot. It is an open standard adopted by various other AI tools and platforms, such as Claude Desktop, Copilot Studio, Cursor AI, and Pieces App.2 This broad adoption means that once developers have configured MCP servers, they can potentially leverage these integrations across different AI-powered environments, enhancing their overall development workflow. The design of MCP as an open standard fosters a broader ecosystem of interoperable AI tools and services, allowing developers to leverage their MCP integrations across different platforms. The "open standard" nature of MCP encourages adoption by various vendors and communities, leading to a richer set of tools and integrations that developers can utilize across their preferred AI-powered environments.  
For more granular control over how Copilot utilizes MCP tools, the .github/copilot-instructions.md file can be used within a repository.44 This file allows for fine-tuning tool usage and providing specific instructions to Copilot regarding when and how to use certain tools within the context of that repository.

## **Step 5: Troubleshooting and Best Practices**

Integrating MCP with GitHub Copilot can sometimes present challenges. Common issues include problems with VS Code updates or GitHub account login, which can usually be resolved by ensuring the software is up-to-date and the correct account credentials are used (refer back to Step 1). If errors occur when starting or connecting to MCP servers, checking the server logs can provide valuable information for diagnosing the problem.38 If configured tools are not appearing in Copilot Chat, it's essential to verify the server configuration in the mcp.json file for any syntax errors or incorrect settings. Authentication and authorization issues with MCP servers might require reviewing the server's documentation and configuration, potentially involving concepts like API keys or OAuth.54 Network connectivity problems, particularly with remote MCP servers, might necessitate checking proxy settings within VS Code or the operating system.55  
To ensure a secure and efficient experience, several best practices should be followed when using MCP with GitHub Copilot. **Security** is paramount, as MCP servers have the potential to execute arbitrary code on your machine. Therefore, it is crucial to only add MCP servers from trusted sources and to carefully review the server configurations before starting them.44 Sensitive information, such as API keys, should never be hardcoded directly into the configuration files. Instead, utilize input variables or environment files to manage such credentials securely.44  
Regarding **performance**, be mindful of the resources consumed by running local MCP servers, especially if multiple servers are active simultaneously. For remote servers, consider potential network latency, which might affect the responsiveness of tool invocations. **Maintainability** is enhanced by keeping MCP server configurations well-organized and documented. Regularly updating VS Code and the dependencies of your MCP servers is also crucial for ensuring compatibility and security.  
**User consent and control** are fundamental principles of MCP. Understand the permissions required by each MCP server to access data and perform actions, and ensure these align with your expectations.41 Similarly, be aware of the data being shared with MCP servers and adhere to relevant **data privacy** policies.41 Exercise caution when invoking **tools**, as they can execute arbitrary code. Always understand what a tool does before authorizing its use.41 Finally, be aware of and control any LLM **sampling requests** that might be initiated by MCP servers.41 The security considerations underscore the importance of developer vigilance when integrating external tools with AI assistants, emphasizing the need for trust and careful configuration.

## **Conclusion**
