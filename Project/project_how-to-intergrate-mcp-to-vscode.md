## What is MCP?

**The Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open standard developed by Anthropic** to simplify and standardize how large language models (LLMs) integrate with external tools, databases, and APIs. You can think of MCP as the *“USB-C port”* for AI models—just as USB-C unified device connectivity, MCP aims to create a universal interface for AI-to-tool interaction.

Originally built to enhance **Claude’s** ability to interact with external systems, MCP was **open-sourced in early 2024** to promote industry-wide adoption. By making the protocol public, Anthropic’s goal was to establish a shared infrastructure for tool communication that minimizes the need for custom integrations, while boosting  **modularity** ,  **interoperability** , and **developer productivity** in AI applications.

Through MCP, language models can:

* Dynamically invoke APIs and fetch real-time data
* Interact with databases and third-party tools using a consistent format
* Avoid hardcoded logic, making model behavior more flexible and maintainable

In short,  **MCP is reshaping how AI models plug into the real world** —shifting from isolated, monolithic systems to flexible, tool-aware agents that can reason, retrieve, and act using standardized methods.
