# How to Change the Appearance of Firefox on Windows to Look Like macOS

Firefox is one of the most customizable browsers out there, and if you're someone who enjoys the sleek, minimalist design of macOS but works on Windows, you might want to bring that Mac-like elegance to your browsing experience. Fortunately, with a few tweaks, you can make Firefox on Windows look remarkably similar to its macOS counterpart.

> TL;DR: Install a Mac-style theme, adjust compact mode, hide window controls, and tweak fonts and menus using `userChrome.css`.

## Why Mac-style?

Many users prefer the clean, uniform UI of macOS. Firefox on macOS reflects this with:

* Rounded tabs
* Unified top bar
* Minimalist buttons
* Fluent scrollbars and padding

Replicating that look on Windows can:

* Create a more aesthetic browsing environment
* Reduce visual clutter
* Provide UI consistency across platforms if you switch often

## Step 1: Enable UserChrome Tweaks in Firefox

Firefox disables `userChrome.css` by default. To enable it:

1. Go to `about:config` in the address bar.
2. Search for:
   ```
   toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets
   ```
3. Set it to `true`.

Then, locate your Firefox profile folder:

* Press `Win + R`, type `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`, and hit Enter.
* Open the folder ending in `.default-release`.

Inside it, create a folder called `chrome` if it doesn’t exist. Inside `chrome`, create a file named `userChrome.css`.

## Step 2: Install a macOS-style Firefox Theme

Open Firefox Add-ons and install one of the following themes:

### Recommended Themes:

* **"macOS Safari (Light/Dark)"**

  [Install on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macos-safari-theme/)
* **"Photon macOS"** (for those who prefer Firefox's Photon UI with mac aesthetics)

  [Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/photon-mac/)

## Step 3: Use `userChrome.css` to Refine Mac Look

Here’s a basic Mac-style tweak for Firefox:

```css
/* Make tabs rounded like macOS */
.tabbrowser-tab {
  border-radius: 6px !important;
  padding: 0 6px !important;
}

/* Hide minimize, maximize, close buttons */
.titlebar-buttonbox-container {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Move tab bar up for a unified top bar look */
#TabsToolbar {
  margin-top: -10px !important;
}
```

Save the file, then restart Firefox.

## Step 4: Set Compact Mode and Mac Fonts

* In Firefox, go to  **Settings > Customize Toolbar** .
* Under  **Density** , select  **Compact** .

You can also go to:

 **Settings > Fonts** , and set:

* Serif: **Times New Roman**
* Sans-serif: **Helvetica Neue** or **San Francisco** (install these manually if not available)

To install Mac fonts on Windows, search for  **"San Francisco font Windows GitHub"** . Install with caution.

---

## Step 5: Optional – Scrollbar and Button Styling

To match macOS-style scrollbars:

```css
/* Thin scrollbar like macOS */
scrollbar {
  width: 6px !important;
}
scrollbar thumb {
  background: #999 !important;
  border-radius: 10px !important;
}
```

Or install the **"SimpleScrollbar"** extension for smoother experience.

---

## Result

After these tweaks, you should see:

* Rounded tabs with padding
* Hidden Windows-style buttons
* Top-aligned tab bar similar to Safari
* Mac-style fonts and minimal spacing
* Thin, flat scrollbars

This makes Firefox look like it belongs on a Mac, even when running on Windows.

---

## Troubleshooting

* If changes don't appear, verify `userChrome.css` is enabled.
* Use `about:support` → *Profile Folder* to double-check you're editing the right location.
* Themes may override some custom styles — test with the default theme first.

## Final Thoughts

Customizing Firefox for a macOS-like appearance isn’t just for aesthetics — it can also help improve focus and reduce cognitive fatigue caused by UI clutter. For users who work cross-platform or prefer a polished interface, this simple change can make your Windows desktop feel more refined.

And if you're building or marketing cross-platform desktop utilities (like your own data recovery product), adopting a UI aesthetic that's familiar to both Mac and PC users can be a subtle but powerful user experience enhancement.
