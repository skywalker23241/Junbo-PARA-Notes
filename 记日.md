测试一共优化了18篇文章,成功了12篇,6篇数据检验没有通过,成功率66%左右,失败的部分应该是ai返回的内容步骤的缺失,待会再去看看.

以下是调试文件失败的日志:

###### Mon Mar 31 16:10:26 CST 2025

在代码构建的时候,添加数据验证板块还是十分重要的,不然ai返回的内容可能会有问题,导致优化失败,其他的就没什么问题了,我会继续优化的.

###### Mon Mar 31 17:02:38 CST 2025

更新了surface的一些文章,感觉还是要手动替换的,虽然内容没什么变化,但是格式还是有点不一样的,还有就是sidebar的内容改了点.

###### Tue Apr 1 08:46:39 CST 2025

愚人节快乐哈哈哈,待会把记日的部分调试文档调整成代码块,优化手机显示.

###### Tue Apr 1 09:05:25 CST 2025

原来这个字体要改成英文才会显示,原来是我之前设置的问题,还以为是系统的问题呢.
